# LaboratoryManager

This little manager had help me during my career as a scientist in a laboratory as there wasn't anything in place in order to manage reagents and do automatic calculations of the tests results that validate products or not.

As a freelance and autodidact programmer, I've choosen JS, PHP, (HTML + CSS with Sass writing) and a WAMP local server in order to do that.

I assume my programmation skills can be improved but it works fine and as it's not supposed to be translated in an "online" manager or in differents media than the 2 computers in the lab (smartphone or tablet, etc...), i didn't pay attention to the responsivity (even if I had enjoyed to do a darkmode for it).
